# json
A library for reading and writing json files. Work in progress...

## library
The json contents are loaded to JSONDocument structure. The structure consists of JSONObjects and JSONArrays which hold the actual data.
The json library uses ptrck which stores allocated pointers to easily free all allocated memory.
